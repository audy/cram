# CRAM

CRAM is a tool developed to analyze data produced from shotgun metagenome sequencing. CRAM was created for people who are familiar with UNIX and command-line interfaces and enables scientists to modify their analysis approach specific to their experiment. It was created to provide an alternative to one-size-fits-all approaches to metagenome annotation.

The default pipeline consists of an assemble, annotate and quantify approach to metagenome analysis. The creation of quantitative data allows for comparison between samples across other variables such as time and space. If this does not suit you, you can easily craft your own approach.
